## Algorithms
In this project, we will delve into the following sorting algorithms:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Counting Sort
7. Radix Sort
8. Shell Sort

Each algorithm will be thoroughly explained, and their C implementations will be provided for your reference.

## Implemented Algorithms
As of now, the project includes the following sorting algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort

More sorting algorithms will be added progressively, and we encourage contributions from the community to expand the list further.

## Usage
To use the provided sorting algorithms, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the project directory and choose the sorting algorithm you want to use.
3. Open the C file containing the selected algorithm implementation.
4. Customize the input array within the file, if needed.
5. Compile the C program using a C compiler.
6. Run the executable to see the sorting algorithm in action!

## Performance
Each sorting algorithm may have different time complexities and efficiency characteristics. We will analyze and compare the performance of each algorithm on various input sizes. Additionally, we will discuss the best-case, average-case, and worst-case scenarios for these algorithms.

We hope this C program, curated by OMAR ID HMAID, will help you gain a better understanding of sorting algorithms and their applications. Happy sorting in C!

_Keep calm and sort on!_
